# `@haetae/cli{:ts}`

`@haetae/cli{:ts}` contains every feature for Haetae's CLI.<br/>
If you use Haetae only by programatic api (e.g. other `@haetae/*{:ts}` packages), you probably don't need this package.

## `peerDependencies`

**Note**: This might not be exhaustive and lists only Haetae's packages.

- [`@haetae/core{:ts}`](./haetae-core)

## Dependents

- [`haetae{:ts}`](./haetae)

## Installation

<Callout>
  **Are you developing a library(e.g. plugin) for Haetae?** <br />
  It might be more suitable to specify `@haetae/cli{:ts}` as `peerDependencies` than `dependencies`.
</Callout>

### To automatically install `@haetae/cli{:ts}` and its `peerDependencies`

You may want to install `@haetae/cli{:ts}` and its `peerDependencies` all at once. <br/>
[`install-peerdeps`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/install-peerdeps) is a good tool for that.

<br/>

<PkgManagerTabs>
```bash
# As dependencies
npx install-peerdeps @haetae/cli
# As devDependencies
npx install-peerdeps --dev @haetae/cli
```
```bash
# As dependencies
npx install-peerdeps --yarn @haetae/cli
# As devDependencies
npx install-peerdeps --yarn --dev @haetae/cli
```
```bash
# As dependencies
npx install-peerdeps --pnpm @haetae/cli
# As devDependencies
npx install-peerdeps --pnpm --dev @haetae/cli
```
</PkgManagerTabs>

### To manually handle installation

You might want to manually deal with installation.<br/>
First, install `@haetae/cli` itself.

<br/>

<PkgManagerTabs>
```bash
# As dependencies
npm install @haetae/cli
# As devDependencies
npm install --save-dev @haetae/cli
```
```bash
# As dependencies
yarn add @haetae/cli
# As devDependencies
yarn add --dev @haetae/cli
```
```bash
# As dependencies
pnpm add @haetae/cli
# As devDependencies
pnpm add --save-dev @haetae/cli
```
</PkgManagerTabs>

Then, check out `peerDependencies` and manually handle them.<br/>
(e.g. Install them as `dependencies` or set them as `peerDependencies`)

```bash
# This does not install, but just show peerDependencies.
npm info @haetae/cli peerDependencies
```
## CLI

For detailed usage and description as CLI, refer to [CLI](../cli).

## API

### `pkg`

Refer to [introduction#pkg](./introduction#pkg).

### `run`

A function to run the CLI.

**Type**

```ts
() => Promise<void>
```

#### Usage

`@haetae/cli{:ts}` itself is already CLI.
However, if you want to embed the CLI in another package, you can do so by `run`.
**In fact, this is what `haetae{:ts}` does with `@haetae/cli{:ts}`.**

Let's say you want to create a CLI `your-command{:sh}` and `yc{:sh}` (short for `your-command`).

**src/cli.js** of `@your/package{:ts}`

Note that you should add [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) for nodejs.

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
import { run } from '@haetae/cli'
// Or `import { cli: { run } } from 'haetae'`

run()
```

**package.json** of `@your/package`

```jsonc
{
  "name": "@your/package",
  "files": [
    "src"
  ],
  "bin": {
    "your-command": "src/cli.js",
    "yc": "src/cli.js"
  }
}
```

After installing `@your/package{:ts}`, `npx your-command{:sh}` or `npx yc{:sh}` would execute **src/cli.js**.<br/>
Refer to the official [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#bin) for more detail.
